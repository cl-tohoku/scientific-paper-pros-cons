Coreference	O
resolution	O
is	O
the	O
task	O
of	O
partitioning	O
a	O
set	O
of	O
mentions	O
(	O
i.e.	O
person	O
,	O
organization	O
and	O
location	O
)	O
into	O
entities	O

A	O
mention	O
is	O
an	O
instance	O
of	O
textual	O
reference	O
to	O
an	O
object	O
,	O
which	O
can	O
be	O
either	O
named O
( O

Barack	O

or	O
pronominal	O
(	O
e.g.	O
he	O
,	O
his	O
,	O
it	O
)	O

An	O
entity	O
is	O
an	O
aggregate	O
of	O
all	O
the	O
mentions	O
(	O
of	O
any	O
level	O
)	O
which	O
refer	O

one	O

in	O
the	O
following	O
sentence O
:	O
John	O

there	O
are	O
four	O
mentions O
:	O
John	O

John	O

his	O
belong	O
to	O
the	O
one	O
entity	O
since	O
they	O
refer	O
to	O
the	O

both	O
