In	O
this	O
paper	O
we	O
approach	O
the	O
problem	O
of	O
coreference	O
resolution	O
and	O
its	O
evaluation	O
metrics	O
.	O

We	O
consider	O
this	O
problem	O
from	O
a	O
slightly	O
different	O
perspectiveâ€”not	O
as	O
a	O
simple	O
clustering	O
problem O
, O
but	O
rather	O
as	O
a	O
problem	O
of	O
extracting	O
information	O
from	O
text	O
.	O

We	O
make	O
an	O
observation	O
that	O
not	O
every	O
mention	O
carries	O
equal	O
amount	O
of	O
information	O
,	O
e.g. O
, O
when	O
considering	O
a	O
pronoun	O
resolution	O
problem	O
there	O
are	O
usually	O
a	O
few	O
named	O
entities	O
that	O
can	O
be	O
assigned	O
to	O
real	O
world	O
objects	O
and	O
relatively	O
larger	O
amount	O
of	O
pronouns	O
that	O
carry	O
almost	O
no	O
information	O
about	O
the	O
object	O
they	O
are	O
referring	O
to	O
,	O
without	O
resolving	O
the	O
coreference	O
with	O
the	O
named	O
entity	O
.	O

Thus	O
we	O
do	O
not	O
want	O
to	O
treat	O
named	O
entities	O
and	O
pronouns	O
equally	O
as	O
in	O
the	O
case	O
below	O
.	O

We	O
can	O
imagine	O
a	O
document	O
with	O
two	O
named	O
entities	O
,	O
for	O
simplicity	O
each	O
with	O
equal	O
count	O
of	O
n	O
pronouns	O
in	O
gold	O
coreferential	O
clusters O
:	O

{ O
Romeo	O
,	O
he	O
1	O
,	O
he	O
2	O
,	O
...	O
,	O
he	O
n	O
} O
{ O
Juliet	O
,	O
she	O
1	O
,	O
she	O
2	O
,	O
...	O
,	O
she	O
n	O
}	O

and	O
two	O
possible	O
system	O
responses	O
,	O
one	O
with	O
two	O
pronouns	O
interchanged	O
between	O
coreferential	O
clusters O
:	O

{ O
Romeo	O
,	O
she	O
1	O
,	O
he	O
2	O
,	O
...	O
,	O
he	O
n	O
} O
{ O
Juliet	O
,	O
he	O
1	O
,	O
she	O
2	O
,	O
...	O
,	O
she	O
n	O
}	O

and	O
the	O
second	O
with	O
the	O
named	O
entities	O
inter-changed O
:	O

{ O
Juliet	O
,	O
he	O
1	O
,	O
he	O
2	O
,...	O
,	O
he	O
n	O
} O
{ O
Romeo	O
,	O
she	O
1	O
,	O
she	O
2	O
,	O
...	O
,	O
she	O
n	O
}	O

According	O
to	O
the	O
measures	O
which	O
do	O
not	O
distinguish	O
between	O
types	O
of	O
mentions	O
and	O
are	O
based	O
only	O
on	O
the	O
similarity	O
of	O
clusters	O
,	O
these	O
two	O
responses	O
are	O
scored	O
equally	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
from	O
information	O
extraction	O
perspective	O
the	O
first	O
answer	O
is	O
almost	O
correct	O
,	O
while	O
the	O
second	O
gives	O
us	O
totally	O
incorrect	O
information	O
about	O
both	O
named	O
entities	O
.	O

Thus	O
we	O
propose	O
a	B-NEU
supplementary	I-NEU
method	I-NEU
to	O
score	O
the	O
performance	O
of	O
coreference	B-NEU
resolution	I-NEU
systems	I-NEU
with	O
respect	O
to	O
different	O
types	O
