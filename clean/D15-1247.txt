We	O
give	O
two	O
examples	O
of	O
the	O
interactions:	O

(1)	O
British	O
bank	O
Barclays	O
had	O
agreed	O
to	O
buy O
( O

)	O
Spanish	O

The	O
combination O
( O
E2	O
)	O
of	O
the	O
banking	O
operations	O
of	O
Barclays	O
Spain	O
and	O

(2)	O
The	O
Palestinian	O

condemned	O
the	O
attack O
( O
E3 O
) O
, O
saying	O
it O
( O
E4	O

would	O
divert	O

from	O
the	O

E1	O
corefers	O
to	O
E2	O
,	O
and	O
E3	O
does	O
to	O
E4.	O
E2	O
is	O
more	O
abstract	O
than	O
E1	O
,	O
and	O
has	O
less	O
evidence	O
of	O
being	O
an	O
event	O
.	O

E4	O
is	O
a	O
pronoun	O
,	O
and	O
thus	O
may	O
seem	O
to	O
refer	O
to	O
an	O
entity	O
rather	O
than	O
an	O
event	O
.	O

Thus O
, O
E2	O
and	O
E4	O
are	O
relatively	O
difficult	O
to	O
be	O
recognized	O
as	O
events	O
by	O
themselves	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
event	O
coreference	O

which	O
is	O

primarily	O
by	O
E2’s	O
participants	O
Barclays	O
and	O
Zaragozano	O
shared	O
with	O
E1	O
,	O
helps	O
determine	O
that	O
E2	O
is	O
an	O
event	O
.	O

The	O
same	O
logic	O
applies	O
to	O
E3	O
and	O
E4.	O
On	O
the	O
other	O
hand	O
,	O
previous	B-NEU
works	I-NEU
typically	O
rely	O
on	O
a	B-NEU
pipelined	I-NEU
model	I-NEU
that	O
extracts	O
events	O
(	O
e.g.	O
,	O
E1	O
and	O
E3	O
)	O
at	O
the	O
first	O
stage	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
resolves	O
event	O
coreference	O
at	O
the	O
second	O

Although	O
this	O
modularity	O
is	O

from	O
development	O
perspectives	O
,	O
the	B-NEG

limits	O
the	O

That	O
is O
, O
the	O
first	O
stage	O
alone	O
is	O
unlikely	O
to	O
detect	O
E2	O
and	O
E4	O
as	O
events	O
due	O
to	O
the	O
difficulties	O
described	O
above	O

These	O
missing	O
events	O
make	O
it	O
impossible	O
for	O
the	O

to	O

event	O

E1-E2	O
and	O

In	O
this	B-NEU
work	I-NEU
we	O
address	O
the	O
problem	O
using	O
the	O
ProcessBank	O
corpus	O
(	O

Following	O
the	O
terminology	O
defined	O
in	O
the	O
corpus	O
,	O
we	O
introduce	O
several	O
terms:	O

•	O
Event O
:	O
an	O
abstract	O
representation	O
of	O
a	O
change	O
of	O
state O
, O
independent	O
from	O
particular	O

•	O
Event	O

:	O
main	O
word O
( O
s	O
)	O
in	O
text	O
,	O
typically	O
a	O
verb	O
or	O
a	O
noun	O
that	O
most	O
clearly	O
expresses	O
an	O
event	O
.	O

•	O
Event	O
arguments O
:	O
participants	O
or	O
attributes	O
in	O
text O
, O
typically	O
nouns	O
,	O
that	O
are	O
involved	O
in	O
an	O
event	O
.	O

•	O
Event	O
mention O
:	O
a	O
clause	O
in	O
text	O
that	O
describes	O
an	O
event O
, O
and	O
includes	O
both	O
a	O
trigger	O
and	O
arguments	O
.	O

•	O
Event	O
coreference O
:	O
a	O
linguistic	O
phenomenon	O
that	O
two	O
event	O
mentions	O
refer	O
to	O
the	O
same	O
event	O

We	O
aim	O
to	O
explore	O
the	O
interactions	O
between	O
event	O

and	O
event	O
coreference	O

As	O
a	O
first	O
step	O
toward	O
the	O
goal	O
,	O
we	O
focus	O
on	O
the	O
task	O
of	O
identifying	O
event	O
triggers	O
and	O
resolving	O
event	O
coreference	O

propose	O
a	B-NEU

perceptron	I-NEU
(	O
Collins	O

that	O
simultaneously	O

them	O

Our	O
assumption	O
is	O
that	O
the	B-POS
joint	I-POS
model	I-POS
is	O
able	O
to	O
capture	O
the	O
interactions	O
between	O
event	O

and	O
event	O
coreference	O
adequately	O
,	O
and	O
such	O
comprehensive	O
decision	O
improves	O
the	O
system	O
performance	O
.	O

For	O
instance	O
,	O
the	O
joint	O
model	O
is	O
likely	O
to	O
extract	O
E2	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
E1	O
successfully	O
via	O
their	O
event	O
coreference	O
by	O
simultaneously	O

at	O

Our	O
contributions	O
are	O
as	O
follows:	O

1. O
This	O
is	O
the	O
first	O
work	O
that	O
simultaneously	O
predicts	O
event	O

and	O
event	O
coreference	O
using	O
a	B-NEU
single	I-NEU
joint	I-NEU
model	I-NEU
. O

At	O
the	O
core	O
of	O
the	O
model	O
is	O
a	B-NEU
document-level	I-NEU
structured	I-NEU
perceptron	I-NEU
algorithm	I-NEU
that	O
learns	O
event	O
triggers	O
and	O
event	O
coreference	O
jointly	O
.	O

2. O
The	O
incremental	O
token-based	O
prediction	O
in	O
joint	O
decoding	O
poses	O
a	O
challenge	O
of	O
synchronizing	O
the	O
assignments	O
of	O
event	O
triggers	O
and	O
coreference	O
.	O

To	O
avoid	O
this	O
problem	O
,	O
we	O
propose	O
an	B-NEU
incremental	I-NEU
decoding	I-NEU
algorithm	I-NEU
that	O
combines	O
the	O
segment-based	O
decoding	O
and	O
best-first	B-NEU

algorithm	I-NEU

3.	O
Our	B-NEU
experiments	I-NEU
indicate	O
that	O
the	B-POS
joint	I-POS

achieves	O
a	O
substantial	O
performance	O
gain	O
in	O
event	O
