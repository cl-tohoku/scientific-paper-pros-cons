The	O
challenge	O
stems	O
in	O

from	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O
an	O

Each	O

In	O

In	O

MLNs	B-POS

for	O

in	O

A	O

the	O

MLNs	B-NEG

is	O
the	O
high	O

The	B-NEG

For	O

the	B-NEG

ill-suited	O

Therefore	O

a	O
major	O
contribution	O

our	B-NEU

lies	O
in	O
the	O
proposal	O

a	O
novel	B-POS

approach	I-POS
where	O
we	O
embed	O
such	O
features	O

weighted	O
unit	O

in	O
a	O
low-dimensional	O
space	O

and	O
then	O
integrate	O
these	O
clauses	O
with	O
the	O
rest	O
of	O
the	O
MLN	O

during	O

Since	O
this	O
idea	O
