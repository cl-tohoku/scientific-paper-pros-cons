In	O

assume	O
a	B-NEU

Identifying	O
the	O

a	O
phrase	O

closely	O

the	O

Thus	O
,	O
the	O
annotation	O
layers	O
provided	O
in	O
the	O
two	O
shared	O
tasks	O
led	O
to	O
the	O
development	O
of	O
successful	O
methods	O
for	O
MD	O
that	O
were	O
mostly	O
based	O
on	O
the	O
underlying	O

of	O
the	O
sentences	O

To	O
our	O
knowledge	O
most	O
state-of-the-art	O
CR	O
systems	O
have	O
not	O
regarded	O
MHD	O
as	O
a	O
stand-alone	O
subtask	O
of	O
CR	O
,	O
but	O
rather	O
as	O
part	O
of	O
the	O

Since	O
mentions	O
often	O
correspond	O
to	O

most	O
approaches	O
use	O
variants	O
of	O
head	O

which	O
were	O
made	O
popular	O
by	O
Collins	O
(	O

)	O

Such	O
rules	O
are	O
manually	O

and	O

where	O
to	O
find	O
the	O
head	O
for	O
an	O
individual	O
syntactic	O
category	O
.	O

In	O
this	O
work	O
,	O
we	O
pursue	O
the	O
goal	O
of	O
MCR	O
in	O
the	O
sense	O
that	O
we	O
are	O
developing	O
an	O
architecture	O
that	O
allows	O
CR	O
for	O
multiple	O
languages	O
with	O
only	O
a	O
minimal	O
adaptation	O
to	O
the	O
individual	O
language	O
.	O

This	O
means	O
that	O
we	O
also	O
need	O
a	B-NEU
multilingual	I-NEU
approach	I-NEU
to	O
MHD	O
that	O

not	O
