Same	O

NLP	O
tasks	O
such	O
as	O

interest	O
in	O
cross-lingual	O

techniques	O
,	O
mostly	O
aiming	O
at	O
under-resourced	O

However	O

little	O
attention	O

paid	O
to	O
leveraging	O
cross-lingual	O
information	O
for	O
CR	O
in	O
two	O
resource-rich	O
languages	O
.	O

This	O
is	O
probably	O
due	O
to	O
lack	O
of	O
bilingual	O
resources	O
annotated	O
with	O
coreference	O
since	O
such	B-NEG
techniques	I-NEG
would	O
require	O
rich	O
linguistic	O
annotation	O
on	O
both	O
sides	O
of	O
the	O
bitext	O
.	O

Moreover	O
,	O
to	O
solve	O
this	O
issue	O
using	O
a	B-NEU

one	O
needs	O

to	O
perform	O
better	O
than	O
if	O

The	O
motivation	O
for	O
solving	O
this	O
task	O
is	O
threefold	O
.	O

Firstly	O
,	O
even	O
though	O
Statistical	B-POS

( I-POS
SMT	I-POS
)	I-POS
has	O
been	O
attracting	O
interest	O
of	O
the	O
community	O
for	O
years	O
,	O
most	B-NEG
systems	I-NEG
do	O
not	O
take	O
information	O
beyond	O
the	O
sentence	O
boundary	O
into	O
account	O
,	O
leaving	O
the	O
issues	O
of	O
discourse	O
coherence	O
unresolved	O
.	O

Having	O
a	O
better-quality	O
bitext	O
with	O
coreference	O
resolved	O
could	O
drive	O
research	O
in	O
discourse-aware	O
SMT	O
forward	O
.	O

Secondly	O
,	O
although	O
inter-sentential	O
relations	O
are	O
neglected	O
in	O
SMT	O
,	O
current	B-NEG
phrase-based	I-NEG
system	I-NEG
unintentionally	O
resolve	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
coreference	O
links	O
within	O
the	O
sentence	O
,	O
using	O
just	O
the	O
power	O
of	O
phrases	O
.	O

This	O
might	O
be	O
leveraged	O
by	O
using	O
the	O
SMT	O
output	O
instead	O
of	O
a	O
human-translated	O
output	O
in	O
a	O
cross-lingual	O
CR	O
scenario	O
.	O

Finally	O
,	O
even	O
monolingual	O
CR	O
may	O
be	O
improved	O
by	O
applying	O
semi-supervised	B-POS
learning	I-POS
methods	I-POS
in	O
a	O
smart	O
way	O
on	O
a	O
large	O

Our	O

cross-lingual	O
CR	O
on	O
the	O
Czech-English	O

We	O
focus	O
on	O
CR	O
of	O
English	O
pronouns	O
,	O
particularly	O
the	O
3rd	O
person	O
central	O
pronouns	O
.	O

Central	O
pronouns	O
is	O
a	O
term	O
coined	O
by	O
Quirk O
( O
1985	O
)	O
embracing	O
personal	O
,	O
possessive	O
and	O
reflexive	O

For	O
the	O
sake	O
of	O
simplicity	O
,	O
we	O
will	O
denote O
3rd	O

central	O
pronouns	O

We	O
ignore	O

Second	O
,	O
the	O
language	O
differences	O
between	O
languages	O
show	O
more	O
clearly	O
on	O
pronouns	O
than	O
on	O
nouns	O
,	O
as	O
pronouns	O
tend	O
to	O
be	O
more	O
constrained	O
by	O
various	O
grammar	O
rules	O
across	O
different	O
languages	O
.	O

Czech	O
and	O
English	O
are	O
typologically	O
distant	O
languages	O
,	O
which	O
is	O
also	O
reflected	O
in	O
different	O
behavior	O
of	O

A	O
cross-lingual	O
CR	O
system	O
could	O
substantially	O
benefit	O
from	O
the	O
necessity	O
of	O
the	O
anaphor	O
and	O
its	O
antecedent	O
to	O

in	O
gender	O

Czech	O
uses	O
grammatical	O
genders	O
which	O
are	O
more	O
evenly	O
distributed	O
among	O
nouns	O
than	O
the	O

However	O
,	O

from	O
the	O
pronoun’s	O

becomes	O
problematic	O
for	O
personal	O

in	O

which	O
are	O
usually	O
dropped	O
from	O
the	O

If	O
their	O
governing	O
verb	O
is	O
in	O
the	O
past	O

the	O

in	O
present	O
or	O

the	O

Possessive	O

are	O
used	O
to	O
a	O
greater	O
extent	O
in	O
English	O
than	O
in	O
Czech	O

Same	O
as	O

they	O
play	O
the	O
role	O
of	O
determiners	O
whereas	O
in	O
Czech,the	O

A	O
