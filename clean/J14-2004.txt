was	O
originally	O

One	O

was	O
proposed	O
by	O
Davidson	O
(	O

who	O
argued	O
that	O
two	O

if	O

the	O

Later	O
on	O

a	O

theory	O
was	O
proposed	O
by	O
Quine	O
(	O
1985	O
)	O
,	O
who	O
considered	O
that	O
each	O

a	O

object	O
(	O
which	O
is	O
well	O
defined	O

,	O
and	O
therefore	O
,	O
two	O

are	O
identical	O
if	O
their	O

have	O
the	O

for	O
our	O

constitutes	O
a	B-NEU
more	I-NEU
realistic	I-NEU
approach	I-NEU
because	O

encode	O
an	O

2)	O
We	O
redefine	O
the	O
task	O
of	O
finding	O
clusters	O
of	O
mentions	O
that	O
refer	O
to	O
the	O
same	O
events	O
as	O
the	O
task	O
of	O
identifying	O
those	O

These	O

the	O

each	O
of	O
these	O

are	O
characterized	O
by	O
a	O
large	O
set	O
of	O
features	O

Because	O
of	O
this	O
,	O
we	O
desire	O
that	O
the	O

associated	O

3)	O
Although	O
each	O

Some	O
of	O
these	O

of	O

To	O
address	O
these	O
problems	O
,	O
we	O
wish	O
to	O
incorporate	O
into	O
the	B-NEU
Bayesian	I-NEU

a	O
feature	O
selection	O
mechanism	O
that	O
is	O
able	O
to	O

build	O
a	O

the	O

that	O
only	O
these	O
salient	O
features	O
will	O
participate	O
in	O
the	O
process	O
of	O
clustering	O
event	O
mentions	O
.	O

In	O
this	O
regard	O
,	O
we	O
assume	O
that	O
a	O
feature	O
is	O
salient	O
if	O
it	O
corresponds	O
to	O
a	O
large	O
number	O
of	O
samples	O
in	O
the	O
generative	O
process	O
.	O

We	O
denote	O
the	O
size	O
of	O
the	O
salient	O
feature	O
set	O
by	O
M	O
.	O

Furthermore	O
,	O
in	O
spite	O
of	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O
the	O
initial	O
feature	O
space	O
describing	O
event	O
mentions	O
can	O
have	O
an	O
unbounded	O
number	O
of	O
features	O
,	O
we	O
want	O
the	O
set	O
of	O
salient	O
features	O
to	O
be	O
finite	O
(	O
i.e.	O
,	O
M–finite	O
)	O
at	O
any	O
given	O
point	O
in	O
time	O
during	O
the	O
generative	O
process	O
corresponding	O
to	O
each	B-NEU
Bayesian	I-NEU
model	I-NEU
. O

4)	O
Finally	O
,	O
we	O
also	O
want	O
our	B-NEU
Bayesian	I-NEU
models	I-NEU
to	O
capture	O
the	O
structural	O
dependencies	O
of	O
the	O
observable	O
objects	O
.	O

In	O
this	O
way	O
,	O
the	B-NEU
models	I-NEU
can	O
take	O
advantage	O
of	O
the	O
sequential	O
order	O
in	O
which	O
the	O
event	O
mentions	O
are	O
generated	O
inside	O
each	O
document	O

We	O
believe	O
that	O
these	O
four	O
desiderata	O
constitute	O
a	B-NEU
more	I-NEU
natural	I-NEU
approach	I-NEU
for	O
clustering	O
complex	O
linguistic	O

from	O
