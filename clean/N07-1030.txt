In	O
this	O
paper	O

we	O
propose	O
to	O
recast	O
the	O
task	O
of	O
coreference	O

as	O
an	O
optimization	O
problem O

namely	O
an	B-NEU

This	B-POS
framework	I-POS
has	O
several	O
properties	O
that	O
make	O
it	O
highly	O
suitable	O
for	O
addressing	O
the	O
two	O

problems	O

The	O
first	O
is	O
that	O
it	O
can	O
utilize	O
existing	O
classifiers	O
;	O
ILP	B-POS
performs	O
global	O
inference	O
based	O
on	O
their	O
output	O
rather	O
than	O
formulating	O
a O
new	O
inference	O
procedure	O
for	O
solving	O
the	O
basic	O
task	O

Second	O
,	O
the	B-POS
ILP	I-POS
approach	I-POS
supports	O
inference	O
over	O
multiple	O
classifiers	O

without	O

special	O

Third	O
,	O
it	B-POS
is	O
much	O
more	O

than	O
conditional	B-NEG

This	O
paper	O
focuses	O
on	O
the	O
first	O
problem	O

proposes	O
to	O
model	O
anaphoricity	O

coreference	O

as	O
a	O
joint	O
task	O
,	O
wherein	O
the	O
decisions	O
made	O
by	O
each	O
locally	B-NEU

are	O
mutually	O
constrained	O

The	O
presentation	O
of	O

proceeds	O
in	O
two	O
steps	O

In	O
the	O
first	O
,	O
intermediary	O
step	O
,	O
we	O
simply	O
use	O
ILP	B-NEU
to	O
find	O
a	O
global	O
assignment	O
based	O
on	O
decisions	O
made	O
by	O
the	B-NEU
coreference	I-NEU
classifier	I-NEU
alone	O
.	O

The	O
resulting	O
assignment	O
is	O
one	O
that	O
maximally	O
agrees	O
with	O
the	O
decisions	O
of	O
the	O
classifier	O
,	O
that	O
is	O
,	O
where	O
all	O
and	O
only	O
the	O
links	O
predicted	O
to	O
be	O
coreferential	O
are	O
used	O
for	O
constructing	O
the	O
chains	O
.	O

This	O
is	O
in	O
contrast	O
with	O
the	B-NEG
usual	I-NEG
clustering	I-NEG
algorithms	I-NEG
in	O
which	O
a	O
unique	O
antecedent	O
is	O
typically	O
picked	O
for	O
each	O
anaphor	O
(	O

The	O
second	O
step	O
provides	O
the	O
joint	O
formulation O
:	O
the	B-NEU
coreference	I-NEU
classifier	I-NEU
is	O
now	O
combined	O
with	O
an	B-NEU
anaphoricity	I-NEU
classifier	I-NEU

constraints	O
are	O
added	O
to	O
ensure	O
that	O
the	O
ultimate	O
coreference	O
and	O
anaphoricity	O
decisions	O
are	O
mutually	O
consistent	O

Both	B-POS
of	I-POS
these	I-POS
formulations	I-POS
achieve	O
significant	O
performance	O

over	O
the	B-NEG
base	I-NEG

Specifically	O

the	B-POS

model	I-POS
achieves	O
f-score	O
improvements	O
of	O
3.7-5.3%	O
on	O
three	O
datasets	O

We	O
begin	O
by	O
