For	O
coreference	O
resolution	O
the	O
drawback	O
of	O
this	B-NEG
approach	I-NEG
is	O
that	O
decisions	O
are	O
often	O
interdependent	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
even	O
partial	O
gold	O
information	O
is	O
extremely	O
informative	O

Also	O
,	O
previous	B-NEG
work	I-NEG
only	O
considered	O
errors	O

links	O
,	O
which	O
does	O
not	O
capture	O
certain	O
errors	O
in	O
a	O
natural	O
way	O
,	O
e.g.	O
when	O
a	B-NEG
system	I-NEG
incorrectly	O
divides	O
a	O
large	O
entity	O
into	O
two	O
parts	O
,	O
each	O
with	O
multiple	O
mentions	O

Recent	B-NEU
work	I-NEU
has	O
considered	O
some	O
of	O
these	O
issues	O

We	O
present	O
a	B-POS
new	I-POS
tool	I-POS
that	O
automatically	O
classifies	O
errors	O
in	O
the	O
standard	O
output	O
of	O
any	O
coreference	O
resolution	O
system	O
.	O

Our	B-NEU
approach	I-NEU
is	O
to	O
identify	O
changes	O
that	O
convert	O
the	O
system	O
output	O
into	O
the	O
gold	O
annotations	O
,	O
and	O
map	O
the	O
steps	O
in	O
the	O
conversion	O
onto	O
linguistically	O
intuitive	O
error	O
types	O
.	O

Since	O
our	B-NEU
tool	I-NEU
uses	O
only	O
system	O
output	O
,	O
we	O
are	O
able	O
to	O
classify	O
errors	O
made	O
by	O
systems	O
of	O
any	O
architecture	O
,	O
including	O
both	O
systems	O
that	O
use	O
link-based	B-NEU
inference	I-NEU
and	O
systems	O
that	O
use	O
global	B-NEU
inference	I-NEU
methods	I-NEU
. O

Using	O
our	B-NEU
tool	I-NEU
we	O
perform	O
two	O
studies	O
to	O
understand	O
similarities	O
and	O
differences	O
between	O
systems	O
.	O

First	O
,	O
we	O
compare	O
the	O
error	O
distributions	O
on	O
coreference	O
resolution	O
of	O
all	B-NEU
of	I-NEU
the	I-NEU
systems	I-NEU
from	O
the	O
CoNLL	O
2011	O
shared	O
task	O
plus	O
several	O
publicly	O
available	O
systems	O

This	O
comparison	O
adds	O
to	O
the	O
analysis	O
from	O
the	O
shared	O
task	O
by	O
illustrating	O
the	O
substantial	O
variation	O
in	O
the	O
types	O
of	O
errors	O
different	O
systems	O
make	O
.	O

Second	O
,	O
we	O
investigate	O
the	O
aggregate	O
behavior	O
of	O
ten	O
state-of-the-art	O
systems	O
,	O
providing	O
a	O
detailed	O
characterization	O
of	O
each	O
error	O
type	O
.	O

This	O
investigation	O
identifies	O
key	O
outstanding	O
challenges	O
and	O
presents	O
the	O
impact	O
that	O
solving	O
each	O
of	O
them	O
would	O
have	O
in	O
terms	O
of	O
changes	O
in	O
the	O
standard	O
coreference	O
resolution	O
metrics	O
.	O

We	O
find	O
that	O
the	B-NEU
best	I-NEU
systems	I-NEU
are	O
not	O
best	O
across	O
all	O
error	O
types	O
,	O
that	O
a	O
large	O
proportion	O
of	O
span	O
errors	O
are	O
due	O
to	O
superficial	O
parse	O
differences	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
the	O
biggest	O
performance	O
loss	O
is	O
on	O
missed	O
entities	O
that	O
contain	O
a	O
small	O
number	O
of	O

This	O
work	O
presents	O
a	O
comprehensive	O
investigation	O
of	O
