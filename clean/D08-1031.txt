Coreference	O
resolution	O
is	O
the	O
task	O
of	O
grouping	O
all	O
the	O
mentions	O
of	O
entities	O
in	O
a	O
document	O
into	O
equivalence	O
classes	O
so	O
that	O
all	O
the	O
mentions	O
in	O
a	O
given	O
class	O
refer	O
to	O
the	O
same	O
discourse	O
entity	O
.	O

For	O
example	O
,	O
given	O
the	O
sentence	O
(	O
where	O
the	O
head	O
noun	O

each	O
mention	O
is	O
subscripted	O

the	O
task	O
is	O

group	O
the	O

that	O
those	O

Thus	O
coreference	O
is	O
an	O

such	O

the	B-NEU

been	O

As	O

it	O
is	O
possible	O
that	O
some	B-NEG
