The	O
task	O
was	O
to	O
build	O
coreference	O
resolution	O
systems	O
for	O
German	O
and	O

without	O

We	O
adopted	O
and	O
slightly	O

an	B-NEU
approach	I-NEU
previously	O
used	O
by	O

Parallel	O
English-German	O

English-Russian	O
corpora	O
are	O
used	O
to	O
project	O
coreference	O

that	O
had	O
been	O
automatically	O

on	O
the	O
English	O

The	O

Unlike	O
the	B-NEU
previous	I-NEU
works	I-NEU
, O
our	B-NEU
coreference	I-NEU
resolution	I-NEU
system	I-NEU
operates	O
on	O
a	O
level	O
of	O
deep	O
syntax	O
.	O

The	O
original	O
surface	O
representation	O
of	O
coreference	O
thus	O
must	O
be	O
transferred	O
to	O
this	O
level	O
.	O

Likewise	O
,	O
coreference	O
relations	O
found	O
by	O
our	O
system	O
must	O
be	O
in	O
the	O
end	O
transformed	O
back	O
to	O
the	O
surface	O
representation	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
they	O
can	O
be	O
evaluated	O
in	O

with	O
the	O
task’s	O
requirements	O

Our	B-POS

also	O
takes	O
advantage	O
of	O
multiple	B-NEU
models	I-NEU
